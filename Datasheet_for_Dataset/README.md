# MBW Zoo Dataset

By: [Mosam Dabhi](TODO:url) `<mdabhi@andrew.cmu.edu>`, [Chaoyang Wang], [Tim Clifford], [Laszlo Jeni],[Ian Fasel], [Simon Lucey]

As part of making dataset collection more easy and amenable in a wildly unconstrained setup, we collect a dataset of zoo animals using smartphone grade cameras, and annotate (~2\%) of the collected frames with 2D keypoint landmarks. We call this dataset the **Multiview Bootstrapping in the wild (MBW) Zoo dataset**; what follows below is the [datasheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) describing this data. If you use this dataset, please acknowledge it by citing the original paper.


## Motivation

1. **For what purpose was the dataset created?** *(Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.)*

    This dataset was created to generate 2D and 3D labels of articulated objects in unconstrained settings. Such unconstrained and casually collected datasets have a wide variety of applications including entertainment, neuroscience, psychology, ethology, and many fields of medicine. Large offline labeled datasets do not exist for all but the most common articulated object categories (e.g., humans, hands, cars). Hand labeling these landmarks within a video sequence is a laborious task. Learned landmark detectors can help, but can be error-prone when trained from only a few examples. As part of contribution of this paper, we provide this dataset where 2D and 3D labels are generated in very challenging scenarios, using our approach. 
    
    Note that the user is required to only provide handheld videos from 2 or more views and manual 2D keypoint labels for ~15 frames per video. No camera intrinsics or extrinsics information is required to generate the labels shown in this dataset.
    


1. **Who created this dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?**
    
    This dataset was created by Mosam Dabhi. At the time of creation, Mosam is a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

## Composition


1. **What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?** *(Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.)*

    Each instance is an image of an articulated object (zoo animals, birds, and fish). Approximately 2-5% of images have corresponding manual 2D landmark annotation. From here on, we use the term landmark prediction and label interchangeably for convenience. For the remaining images in the sequences, the 2D and 3D landmark labels, as well as bounding box crops labels are generated by *MBW*. In particular, each entity also has a flag *reliable_annotation* that is a boolean specifying how much reliable is the label generated by MBW.



2. **How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?**
    
    The dataset consists instances from 6 different object categories:

    In total, there are **16520** instances in this dataset from **6** different object categories. The overall dataset statistics below reflect the above description:

3. **Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?** *(If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).)*

    It is a sample of all videos captured casually in an unconstrained environment such as zoo. It is not intended to be representative: the data was collected randomly in the order of visit. This data collection process was specifically designed as a proof-of-concept for the approaches mentioned in MBW paper -- to label articulated objects in the wild at scale.

Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.)*
