# MBW Zoo Dataset

By: [Mosam Dabhi](mailto:mdabhi@andrew.cmu.edu) `<mdabhi@andrew.cmu.edu>`, Chaoyang Wang, Tim Clifford, Laszlo Jeni, Ian Fasel, Simon Lucey

As part of making dataset collection more easy and amenable in a wildly unconstrained setup, we collect a dataset of zoo animals using smartphone grade cameras, and annotate (~2\%) of the collected frames with 2D keypoint landmarks. We call this dataset the **Multiview Bootstrapping in the wild (MBW) Zoo dataset**; what follows below is the [datasheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) describing this data. If you use this dataset, please acknowledge it by citing the original paper.


## Motivation

1. **For what purpose was the dataset created?** *(Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.)*

    This dataset was created to generate 2D and 3D labels of articulated objects in unconstrained settings. Such unconstrained and casually collected datasets have a wide variety of applications including entertainment, neuroscience, psychology, ethology, and many fields of medicine. Large offline labeled datasets do not exist for all but the most common articulated object categories (e.g., humans, hands, cars). Hand labeling these landmarks within a video sequence is a laborious task. Learned landmark detectors can help, but can be error-prone when trained from only a few examples. As part of contribution of this paper, we provide this dataset where 2D and 3D labels are generated in very challenging scenarios, using our approach. 
    
    Note that the user is required to only provide handheld videos from 2 or more views and manual 2D keypoint labels for ~15 frames per video. No camera intrinsics or extrinsics information is required to generate the labels shown in this dataset.
    


1. **Who created this dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?**
    
    This dataset was created by Mosam Dabhi. At the time of creation, Mosam is a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
    


1. **Who funded the creation of the dataset?** *(If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.)*

## Composition


1. **What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?** *(Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.)*

    Each instance is an image of an articulated object (zoo animals, birds, and fish). Approximately 2-5% of images have corresponding manual 2D landmark annotation. From here on, we use the term landmark prediction and label interchangeably for convenience. For the remaining images in the sequences, the 2D and 3D landmark labels, as well as bounding box crops labels are generated by *MBW*. In particular, each entity also has a flag *confidence* that is a boolean specifying how much reliable is the label generated by MBW.



2. **<a name="instance_information">How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)? </a>** 
    

    In total, there are **16148** instances in this dataset from **7** different object categories, coming from **2** camera views. The overall dataset statistics below reflect the above description:
    

    | Object        | Frames (#) | Joints (#) | Manual labels (%)  |                Labels from MBW                              | 
    | :---          | :---:      | :---:    | :---:                |                 :---:                                       |
    | Fish          | 1456       | 12       |  2.7                 |  <img width="100" src=../graphics/gr_available.png>         | 
    | Colobus Monkey| 391        | 16       |  5.1                 |  <img width="100" src=../graphics/gr_available_grey_bg.png> |
    | Chimpanzee    | 204        | 16       |  6.3                 |  <img width="100" src=../graphics/gr_available.png>         |
    | Tiger         | 1829       | 14       |  2                 |  <img width="100" src=../graphics/gr_NA_grey_bg.png>        |
    | Clownfish     | 909        | 6        |  2                   |  <img width="100" src=../graphics/gr_NA.png>                |    
    | Seahorse      | 479        | 6        |  2                   |  <img width="100" src=../graphics/gr_NA_grey_bg.png>        |        
    | Turtle        | 2806       | 9       |  2                   |  <img width="100" src=../graphics/gr_NA.png>        |            
    

**Please note**:  We are unable to provide the stereo baseline distance (m) and stereo angle (°) since the data was captured where the cameras were continuously moving thereby changing these metrics. 




3. **<a name="instance_information_2">Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?</a>** *(If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).)*

    It is a sample of all videos captured casually in an unconstrained environment such as zoo. It is not intended to be representative: the data was collected randomly in the order of visit. This data was collected with the intent to show the applicability of MBW in challenging data scenarios -- specifically to label articulated objects in the wild at scale.  




4. **<a name="pkl_information">What data does each instance consist of?</a>** *(``Raw'' data (e.g., unprocessed text or images)or features? In either case, please provide a description.)*

    The dataset is divided into two directories: `annot` and `images`. As names suggest, the `annot` directory contains annotations and `images` directory consists of 2-view synchronized image frames. The annotations are provided as a `.pkl` file. The pickle files consists of following keys:

    | Key        | Description |
    | :---          | :---     |
    | W_GT          | Manual annotation. Non-NaN values for 1-2% of data. NaN values for the rest.      |
    | W_Pred        | 2D landmark predictions (labels) generated from MBW.       | 
    | S_Pred         | 3D landmark predictions (labels) generated from MBW. The 3D reconstructions are up-to-scale.       | 
    | BBox    | Bounding box crops generated from MBW          | 
    | confidence    | Flag specifying confidence for the MBW predictions. `True` specifies high confidence. `False` specifies low confidence. This flag is generated from the uncertainty equation (Eq. 2) given in the paper.          | 


    

5. **Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.**

    As noted in the column **Labels from MBW** in the [instance information table](#instance_information), label or targets for each instance are associated for the categories with flag **Available** (all the fields shown in the table [above](#pkl_information) are available in the pickle file). For the rest, only initial 2% `W_GT` labels are provided, since we did not run MBW that could provide us with labels. We release this dataset to set a benchmark for solving challenging 2D and 3D landmark prediction tasks for in-the-wild unconstrained video captures.
    


6. **Is any information missing from individual instances?** *(If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.)*

    The prediction labels (`W_Pred`, `S_Pred`, `BBox`, and `confidence`) are missing for the categories where MBW is not run as shown in column **Labels from MBW** in the [instance information table](#instance_information) above.
    


7. **Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users' movie ratings, social network links)?** *( If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.)*

    Instances are unrelated.

    

8. **Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?** *(If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.)*

    Since the sole purpose of this data collection was to generate labels from scratch, we expect this data to be used solely for generating labels for unlabeled data. Thus, we do not explicitly provide a training/validation/testing split; however, we recognize that people may wish to do this, or to do some form of cross-validation. We would suggest cross-validation and test split by dividing the manual labels into 80/10/10 split and pick the samples via a uniform sampling strategy.

    


9. **Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?** *(If so, please provide a description.)*

    Since the inital 2D keypoints were manually labeled, there are almost certainly some errors in `W_GT` (the manual label field in the annotation file). We did our best to minimize these, but some certainly remain.
    
    


10. **Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)?** *(If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.)*

## Collection Process

1. **How was the data associated with each instance acquired?** *(Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.)*

    The data was collected by two smartphone cameras without any constraints: meaning no guidance or instructions were given as to how the data was collected. The intention was to mimic the data captured casually by anyone holding a smartphone grade camera. Due to this reason, the cameras were continuously moving in space changing their extrinsics with respect to each other thereby making this a dynamic setup. Thus, this dataset could be used to benchmark robust algorithms in the domain of **sparse non-rigid 2D/3D landmark predictions**, **dense non-rigid shape reconstrctions**, Neural radiance fields **(NeRF)**, as well as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping **(SLAM)**. 



1. **<a name="collect">What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data </a> (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)?** *(How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?)*
    
    We captured 2-View videos from handheld smartphone cameras. In our case, we used an iPhone 11 Pro Max and an iPhone 12 Pro Max to capture the video sequences at ~30 frames-per-second (fps). We use Final Cut Pro to manually synchronize the 2-View video sequences using the audio signal and time stamps. Please note that all we require are 2-view synchronized image frames and manual annotations for 1-2% of the data. 
    
**Please note**: We are unable to provide the stereo baseline distance (m) and stereo angle (°) since the data was captured where the cameras were continuously moving thereby changing these metrics.     


1. **If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?**

    Please refer the answer to [question #2](#instance_information) and [question #3](#instance_information_2) in Composition.
    


1. **Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?**

    The authors were helped by Shraddha Thakkar who graciously volunteered to capture the data during their visit to a Zoo with authors.
    


1. **Over what timeframe was the data collected?** *(Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)?  If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.)*

    The dataset was collected on March 19, 2022.
    


1. **Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)?** *(If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.)*

    No review processes were conducted with respect to the collection of this data. Manual annotation was conducted by visually localizing the joints on the objects whose accuracy was confirmed by visual inspection. 
    


1. **Does the dataset relate to people?** *(If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.)*

    No.
    


1. **Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g., websites)?**

    N/A.
    


1. **Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection?** *(If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.)*

    N/A.
    


1. **Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data?** *(If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.)*

    N/A.
    


1. **If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses?** *(If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).)*
    
    N/A.


1. **Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (e.g., a data protection impact analysis) been conducted?** *(If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.)*
    
    No. 


1. **Any other comments?**
    
    None.





## Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling


1. **Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)?** *(If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this section.)*

    We did not do any specific preprocessing or cleaning of the data except what is mentioned in [question #1](#collect) of Collection Process. Manual annotations were labeled by visually localizing the joints on the objects in the limited (1-2%) image frames.
    


1. **Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)?** *(If so, please provide a link or other access point to the "raw" data.)*

    Yes, the image frames released under the `images/` directory are sampled from the original "raw" video.


1. **Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available?** *(If so, please provide a link or other access point.)*

    Yes. We used open-source [Matplotlib library](https://matplotlib.org) to visualize and label the joints. For further details, please refer [question #1] of this section.

    

1. **Any other comments?**
    
    None.
